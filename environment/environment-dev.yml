  # The returns package requires 0.950 because it calls a method of MessageBuilder that
  # was removed from 0.960 for some reason, which is unclear.  Therefore, running mypy
  # with the returns plugin fails when using mypy versions after 0.950.  However, since
  # the returns plugin appears to generate many false positives, it is commented out,
  # and a newer version of mypy is specified instead.
